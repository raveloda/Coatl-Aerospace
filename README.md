This is a stock-alike (ish) probe expansion pack inspired by real missions from the mid-1960s to now. I will start with basic probe cores, and utility parts and the move on to animated science parts and solar panels. Expect parts inspired by (but no realistic replicas of) Voyager, Galileo, Pioneer 10, Venera, Hubble, Kepler, New Horizons, Juno, And more...
