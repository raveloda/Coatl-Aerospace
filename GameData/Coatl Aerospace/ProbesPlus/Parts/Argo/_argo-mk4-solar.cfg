	manufacturer = Coatl Aerospace
	description =  The Argo Mk4 line for planetary exploration required more electrical power than our previous panels could provide. These new solar cells are made with better materials and are coated to protect them against solar flares and some radiation. A cold-gas RCS system is mounted at the outer edge of the panel. A spring loaded deployment mechanism prevents the panel from being retracted.
