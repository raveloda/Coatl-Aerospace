	description = This nylon-kevlar parachute is adapted from our Fomalhaut lander for use with the Draco lander system. Slightly different parachute geometry passes more air through to lessen the drag effect for thicker atmospheres. As an advantage, the parachute can withstand greater speeds and stress, allowing to be deployed much earlier in the entry procedure
