	description = This High-Resolution Radar System uses its 6 antennas mounted in 3 booms to create very accurate radar scans. The system is very sensitive and can track direction and speed of object in the surface. It was designed to both track the speed of vehicles moving between KSC buildings (For speeding tickets) and to justify yet another satellite launch. Win-win
