		MohoInSpaceHigh = We've discovered a new body orbiting Moho and we're calling it Mohoteor...uh...well, it was there for an instant.

		EveInSpaceLow = Whoa! Looks like the detector just passed through a meteor shower!
		EveInSpaceHigh = Purple planets, purple clouds, purple dust...what the hell are they putting in the food?

		GillyInSpaceLow = That might have been Gilly's even smaller brother...
		GillyInSpaceHigh = Was the rock that just hit you smaller or larger than Gilly?  Not sure...

		DunaInSpaceLow = Yikes! It seems you weren't expecting that impact... or were you?
		DunaInSpaceHigh = It seems like dunaroids are just like any other meteoroid.  Hard as rock and out to kill you at every opportunity

		IkeInSpaceLow = You ask Wehrner if that was the famous magic boulder... Or at least a piece of it.
		IkeInSpaceHigh = Well Ike is here but I don't see Mike anywhere.  What's that splatter on the detector?

		DresInSpaceLow = You stopped counting the number of impacts soon after you arrived at Dres.
		DresInSpaceHigh = If Dres isn't trying to kill you why are there 42 hull patches and no hits on the detector?

		JoolInSpaceLow = It seems that the orbits of any small debris decayed into the gas giant long ago- PING!
		JoolInSpaceHigh = Apparently even the particles are bigger at Jool...

		LaytheInSpaceLow = That impact seemed decidedly... moist.
		LaytheInSpaceHigh = It appears that Laythe has officially sneezed on your detector.  Congratulations on being to first to discover space boogers!

		VallInSpaceLow = Yet another impact... so what?
		VallInSpaceHigh = In sector 637-K the particles are fine and grainy but here they are more coarse.  I think we found...dirt!

		TyloInSpaceLow = The device measures a large impact, followed by many smaller impacts.
		TyloInSpaceHigh = That sound was not the result of an impact but rather was directly caused by space food.  KLANG!  THAT was in impact!

		BopInSpaceLow = Flight, Mission Control. You did not, in fact, just collide with Bop.
		BopInSpaceHigh = Mission Control, Flight.  Did we just collide with Bop?

		PolInSpaceLow = Judging from the impact, we may have impacted something crystalline in nature.
		PolInSpaceHigh = Pol, polled politely, properly produced predicted principles of impacts.

		EelooInSpaceLow = Even out here, it seems spacecraft have to deal with space debris.
		EelooInSpaceHigh = We came, we saw, we got hit by more rocks.

		AsteroidInSpaceLow = Pieces of the asteroid seem to have broken off from the activity around it...
		AsteroidInSpaceHigh = WAIT!  No one said anything about rocks around the rock.
		AsteroidSrfLanded = The detector pings angrily as it is pelted from the debris of our landing.

		//Outer planets Mod

		SarnusInSpace = Impacts detected, could be deflected ring particles
		SarnusInSpaceLow = Yup, Sarnus has rings
		
			TektoInSpace = The instrument registers an impact which then turned out to be the spacecraft yawning
			TektoInSpace = What few impacts are detected at this elevation are minuscule. It appears few ring particles are deflected out here
			
			SlateInSpaceHigh = Impacts detected, could be deflected ring particles
			SlateInSpaceLow = Slate sluggishly slings slippery sleet which slowly slides into the experiment's slot
			
			HaleInSpaceHigh = Impacts detected, could be deflected ring particles
			HaleInSpaceLow = Impacts recorded from Hale do feel a lot like hail back home
			HaleInSpaceLow = As the craft approaches the ring plane, the instruments records the equivalent of tiny popcorn cooking in the microwave
			
			OvokInSpace = Yet another impact... so what?
			OvokInSpace = Even out here, it seems spacecraft have to deal with space debris
			
		UrlumInSpace = It seems that the orbits of any small debris decayed into the gas giant long ago- PING!
		UrlumInSpace = That impact seemed rather cold
		
			WalInSpace = A tiny, icy, impact was recorded
			WalInSpace = All's quiet. Looks like nothing's going to hit
			
				TalInSpace = A tiny, icy, impact was recorded
				TalInSpace = Zero data is good data, right?
				
			PriaxInSpace = Yet another impact... so what?
			PriaxInSpace = Either the detector just passed through a meteor shower, or the popcorn in the break-room is done 
			
			PoltaInSpace = A tiny, icy, impact was recorded
			PoltaInSpace = Some tiny grains are are recorded by the detector, but it is mostly a quiet ride
			
		NeidonInSpace = It seems that the orbits of any small debris decayed into the gas giant long ago- PING!
		NeidonInSpace = Judging from that impact, we may have impacted something crystalline in nature
		
			ThatmoInSpaceHigh = The detector might have picked up an impact from icy crystals near Thatmo
			ThatmoInSpaceLow = This region appears devoid of micrometeorites to detect
